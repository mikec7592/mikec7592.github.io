## My First Project -Jeopardy
Play it here --> [My Jeopardy] (https://mikec7592.github.io/)

### Completely done in Javascript

While going through this project please keep in mind that this is a work in progress.  When this project was started I was working full-time as well as taking care of other obligations.  I certainly plan on revisiting this project over time and refining it.  As it currently stands though, I'm proud of what I have for the resources that were at my disposal especially since I have been struggling with this concept from it's intial introduction.

##### Coding highlights:
- Dynamically created entirely with Javascript
- Html is boilerplate only
- Jquery ;(   <--- sad face?


### How It Works
Boxes are labeled by point value and fall into 4 different categories.  Clicking on a box reveals a question as well as 3 possible answers.  Choosing the correct answer will net you the point value on the face of the clicked box.  Chosing the incorrect answer will decrease your score by the face value.


### Win Conditions

Your goal is to reach 2000 points.  After submitting every answer you will be alerted via text box if you were correct as well as your current point total.  Upon reaching your goal you will alerted that you won and can either continue playing or use the manual reset button located at the bottom left of the page.

### Loss Conditions

If at any point your score drops to -200 you will be alerted via textbox and your game will automatically be reset.  There is also a manual reset button that can be used at any time located at the bottom left of the page.
